# Island-Adventure-Prototype


This is a Prototype of a Text based Roguelike game with heavy emphasis on exploration. It is far from feature complete. Currently it includes a procedurally generated island that can be explored and a rudimentary time system. 


It is written in Python and uses the rich (https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) module.


## How to Run

For Linux(Only tested on Mint) and Windows you can use these executables:

*put exes here*

Alternatively you can just run the python script.

 


Python 3.8 was used to program this game, although I am fairly sure it should work with an up to date version of 3.6.

The rich module is needed for this to run, use:

```
pip install rich
```

To install it.

Then just run the main.py file.
